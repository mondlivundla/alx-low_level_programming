Task 0. strcat
Aim: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
This function appends the src string to the dest string,
overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest,
and then adds a terminating null byte.
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.
Filename: 0-strcat.c



Task 1. strncat
Aim: Write a function that concatenates two strings.
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
Filename: 1-strncat.c



Task 2. strncpy
Aim: Write a function that copies a string.
The function should work exactly like strncpy
Filename: 2-strncpy.c



Task 3. strcmp
Aim: Write a function that compares two strings.
The function should work exactly like strcmp
Filename: 3-strcmp.c



Task 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
Aim: Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
Where n is the number of elements of the array
Filename: 4-rev_array.c




Task 5. Always look up
Aim: Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
Filename: 5-string_toupper.c




Task 6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes
Aim: Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
