Task 0. memset
Objective: Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
Aim: The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Return: a pointer to the memory area s
Filename: 0-memset.c







Task 1. memcpy
Objective: Write a function that copies memory area.
Aim: The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Return: a pointer to dest
Filename: 1-memcpy.c






Task 2. strchr
Objective: Write a function that locates a character in a string.
Aim:
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
Filename: 2-strchr.c









Task 3. strspn
Objective: Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Output: Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
Filename: 3-strspn.c








Task 4. strpbrk
Objective: Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
Aim: The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Return: a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
Filename: 4-strpbrk.c








Task 5. strstr
Objective: Write a function that locates a substring.
Aim: The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Return: a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
Filename: 5-strstr.c









Task 6. Chess is mental torture
Objective: Write a function that prints the chessboard.
Filename: 7-print_chessboard.c
